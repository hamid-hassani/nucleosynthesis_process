<!-- Reaction rate modification view.  In the example below, the nuclide
     xpath expression selects out isotopes of elements with Z <= 8 and 
     the reaction xpath expression selects out the (p,gamma) reactions.  
     The forward and reverse rates of all valid reactions in this
     particular view are multiplied by a factor of 10 at all temperatures.    
     Uncomment and edit the view as needed to select out the reactions of
     interest.  Copy and paste the view to create multiple views,
     but be sure to label each distinct view with a different tag2.
